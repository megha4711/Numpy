Here’s a detailed breakdown of scenarios where each approach might be preferable:\n","\n","**Multithreading :-**  Multithreading involves running multiple threads in a single process. Threads share the same memory space and resources, which allows for lightweight context switching and efficient communication. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python (specifically CPython), multithreading in Python is not ideal for CPU-bound tasks but works well for I/O-bound tasks.\n","\n","***Scenarios where multithreading is preferable :-***\n","\n","1.  **I/O-bound tasks (such as file I/O, network requests, or database access):**\n","  * Example: A web scraper that makes HTTP requests to multiple websites or an application that downloads files from multiple servers.\n","  * In these cases, the threads spend most of their time waiting for input or output operations (e.g., waiting for data from a disk or a remote server). While one thread is waiting for I/O, other threads can proceed with their work, making good use of the system's idle time.\n","  * The GIL isn't a problem here because it only affects CPU-bound tasks.\n","\n","2.  **Concurrency in GUI applications:**\n","  * Example: A GUI application built with Tkinter or PyQt, where you need to maintain a responsive interface while performing background tasks.\n","  * Multithreading allows you to offload time-consuming tasks (like loading data or processing user inputs) to a background thread while keeping the main thread free to update the UI.\n","\n","3.  **Lightweight, low overhead parallelism:**\n","  * Example: A situation where you have a large number of relatively small tasks that can share the same memory space without consuming too much memory.\n","  * Since threads share the same process memory space, they are lightweight in terms of resource usage compared to processes, which require separate memory spaces.\n","\n","**Advantages of multithreading:**\n","  * Less overhead compared to multiprocessing, since threads within a single process share memory.\n","  * More suitable for I/O-bound operations where the program spends time waiting for external resources.\n","  * Easier to share data between threads since they share the same memory.\n","\n","**Multiprocessing :-** Multiprocessing involves creating multiple independent processes, each with its own memory space. This approach avoids the GIL issue and is better suited for CPU-bound tasks because each process runs independently, allowing true parallel execution on multi-core systems.\n","\n","**Scenarios where multiprocessing is preferable:**\n","\n","1.  **CPU-bound tasks (such as complex computations, number crunching, or data processing):**\n","  * Example: A machine learning training pipeline that performs heavy computations, or a program that processes large datasets using algorithms that require significant CPU resources.\n","  * Since each process runs in its own memory space, Python can utilize multiple CPU cores, achieving true parallelism. The GIL doesn’t limit performance here because each process is independent.\n","\n","2. **Large-scale data processing or parallel algorithms:**\n","  * Example: MapReduce-like parallel algorithms where tasks are independent of one another and can be executed in parallel without the need for communication between processes.\n","  * Tasks such as large-scale matrix operations, simulation tasks, or image processing benefit from multiprocessing since the work can be divided across multiple processes.\n","\n","3. **Isolation of tasks:**\n","  * Example: Running several isolated, independent tasks that should not affect one another’s memory or state.\n","  * Each process has its own memory space, so there's no risk of accidental shared memory modification (which can be an issue in multithreading). This makes multiprocessing ideal for tasks that need complete isolation.\n","\n","**Advantages of multiprocessing:**\n","  * Can fully utilize multiple CPU cores, providing true parallelism.\n","  * No Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) interference, so CPU-bound tasks can run efficiently.\n","  * Each process has its own memory space, reducing the chances of issues from shared memory (e.g., race conditions).\n","\n","**Choosing Between Multithreading and Multiprocessing:**\n","\n","**Use multithreading if:**\n","  * Our tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., network or file I/O).\n","  * We need low overhead and lightweight concurrency.\n","  * We are working with tasks that don’t require much CPU power but need to handle many operations concurrently (e.g., a server handling many incoming requests).\n","\n","**Use multiprocessing if:**\n","  * Our tasks are CPU-bound (e.g., data processing, numerical computation).\n","  * We need to fully utilize multiple cores and achieve true parallelism.\n","  * Our tasks are independent and benefit from isolation (e.g., different independent tasks running in parallel without sharing data).\n","\n","***Conclusion:***\n","  * Multithreading is more efficient for I/O-bound tasks or tasks requiring lightweight concurrent operations where you don’t need to worry about heavy CPU processing.\n","  * Multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks where the program needs to perform intensive computations across multiple cores or when tasks require isolation to avoid interference."],"metadata":{"id":"QU-_BdUBkWmW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### ***Q.2 Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.***\n","\n","Ans :-\n","\n","In Python, a process pool is a collection of worker processes that can be used to execute tasks concurrently. The process pool is a part of the `multiprocessing` module, and it helps efficiently manage multiple processes by reusing processes from a pool rather than creating and destroying processes repeatedly. This can significantly reduce the overhead of process creation and destruction, which can be expensive, especially when you need to execute many independent tasks.\n","\n","**How a Process Pool Works:**\n","* **Initialization :** The process pool is initialized with a fixed number of worker processes. These processes are ready to be assigned tasks.\n","* **Task Assignment :** Tasks (functions) are submitted to the pool, and the pool distributes the tasks to the available worker processes.\n","* **Process Reuse :** After completing a task, a worker process does not terminate. Instead, it waits for the next task. This reuse of processes helps avoid the overhead of creating new processes each time a task is submitted.\n","* **Termination :** Once all tasks are completed, the pool can be closed and the processes in the pool are terminated.\n","\n","This pool-based approach is especially useful when you have a large number of tasks that can be executed in parallel, and it allows you to manage resources more effectively by limiting the number of active processes at any given time.\n","\n","**Why Use a Process Pool?**\n","\n","1.  **Reduced Overhead :-** Spawning new processes can be resource-intensive, especially when the number of tasks is large. A pool of processes allows you to reuse existing worker processes, which reduces the overhead of process creation and termination.\n","2.  **Efficient Resource Management :-** The pool helps you control how many processes are running at any given time. For example, you can limit the number of worker processes to match the number of available CPU cores on your system, ensuring that you don't overwhelm the system with too many processes.\n","3.  **Parallelism :-** By using multiple processes, a process pool can take full advantage of multiple CPU cores, allowing for parallel execution of CPU-bound tasks.\n","4.  **Simplified Management :-** Instead of manually creating and managing individual processes, you use a pool that automatically handles process management and load balancing for you.\n","\n","**Process Pool with the `multiprocessing` Module:**\n","The `multiprocessing.Pool` class provides a simple and efficient way to manage multiple processes in Python. Below is an example to demonstrate how a process pool works.\n","\n","**Example: Using `multiprocessing.Pool`**\n","```\n","import multiprocessing\n","import time\n","\n","# A simple function to compute the square of a number\n","def compute_square(n):\n","    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate a time-consuming task\n","    return n * n\n","\n","# Function to manage the pool and apply the task to multiple inputs\n","def main():\n","    # Create a pool with 4 worker processes\n","    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)\n","\n","    # List of inputs (numbers to compute squares of)\n","    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n","\n","    # Use map to apply the function to each element in the list in parallel\n","    results = pool.map(compute_square, numbers)\n","\n","    # Print the results\n","    print(results)\n","\n","    # Close the pool and wait for the worker processes to finish\n","    pool.close()\n","    pool.join()\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    main()\n","```\n","**Explanation of the Example:**\n","1.  **Creating the Pool :** The multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) creates a pool with 4 worker processes. This means that a maximum of 4 processes can run concurrently.\n","2.  **Submitting Tasks :** The pool.map() function is used to apply the compute_square function to each number in the numbers list. This is similar to using Python's built-in map() function, but here the tasks are distributed across the processes in the pool.\n","3.  **Getting Results :** The map() method returns a list of results once all tasks are completed. The results are returned in the same order as the input list.\n","4.  **Closing the Pool :** The pool.close() call prevents any more tasks from being submitted to the pool, and pool.join() waits for all worker processes to complete before exiting the program.\n","\n","**Key Methods of multiprocessing.Pool:**\n","* `Pool(processes=None)` : Creates a pool with a specified number of worker processes. If processes is not provided, it defaults to the number of CPU cores on the machine.\n","* `map(func, iterable)` : Applies the function func to each item in the iterable, distributing the tasks among the worker processes in the pool. It blocks until all results are returned, and the results are returned in the order of the input list.\n","* `apply(func, args)` : Executes a function func with the given arguments args in a worker process. It blocks and returns the result of the function call.\n","* `apply_async(func, args, callback=None)` : Executes the function func asynchronously, returning a multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult object that can be used to track the task's progress and retrieve the result.\n","* `close()` : Prevents any more tasks from being submitted to the pool. It should be called before join().\n","* `join()` : Waits for all worker processes to complete before continuing.\n","\n","**Advantages of Using a Process Pool :-**\n","1.  **Efficient Resource Management :-**  Process pools control how many processes are running at any time, preventing the system from being overloaded with too many processes. You can tailor the number of processes to match the available CPU cores.\n","2.  **Avoiding Repeated Overhead :-** Instead of creating new processes for each task, which is time-consuming, a pool of worker processes is reused, which significantly reduces overhead.\n","3.  **Parallel Processing :-** A process pool allows true parallel execution of CPU-bound tasks, making it well-suited for programs that require intensive computation.\n","4.  **Simplified Code :-** The pool abstracts away the complexities of managing multiple processes, including synchronization, task distribution, and result gathering.\n","\n","**Conclusion :-**\n","A process pool in Python, provided by the `multiprocessing.Pool` class, is a powerful tool for managing multiple processes efficiently. It helps reduce the overhead of creating and destroying processes, enables parallel execution of tasks, and allows for better resource management by controlling the number of active processes. The pool provides a simple API for parallel execution, whether tasks are CPU-bound or I/O-bound, and can be used both synchronously and asynchronously depending on the specific needs of the program.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0coYLbpCj1Hx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### ***Q.3 Explain what multiprocessing is and why it is used in Python programs.***\n","\n","Multiprocessing in Python is a technique that allows a program to execute multiple processes concurrently. Unlike multithreading, where threads share the same memory space within a single process, multiprocessing uses separate memory spaces for each process. This means that each process runs independently and has its own memory, avoiding issues that arise from sharing memory in a multithreaded environment (such as race conditions or deadlocks).\n","\n","The `multiprocessing` module in Python provides a way to work with multiple processes and manage the execution of parallel tasks. It leverages multiple CPU cores for true parallelism, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require significant computational resources.\n","\n","**Why is Multiprocessing Used in Python Programs?**\n","Multiprocessing is used to achieve parallelism, which can dramatically improve the performance of programs, especially when they are CPU-bound or need to handle large amounts of data. Here are the key reasons why multiprocessing is beneficial in Python:\n","\n","**1. Bypassing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**\n","  One of the key limitations of Python's *CPython* (the most common implementation of Python) is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL is a mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time in a single process. This severely limits the effectiveness of multithreading in Python when it comes to CPU-bound tasks.\n","  * Multithreading in Python is suitable for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., waiting for network responses, file reading, etc.) because during I/O operations, the GIL is released, and other threads can run.\n","  * Multiprocessing, on the other hand, bypasses the GIL by creating separate processes. Each process has its own interpreter and memory space, so they can run on separate CPU cores in parallel, achieving true parallelism.\n","\n","**2. True Parallelism :-**\n","  Since each process in a multiprocessing-based Python program runs on its own memory and has its own GIL, multiple processes can run on multiple CPU cores. This is especially important for CPU-bound tasks, such as :\n","  * Mathematical computations\n","  * Data processing\n","  * Machine learning algorithms\n","  * Image and video processing\n","  * Simulation tasks\n","  \n","Multiprocessing takes advantage of multi-core systems, which allows your program to perform multiple operations at the same time (parallel execution).\n","\n","3. **Isolation and Fault Tolerance :-**\n","  Each process in a multiprocessing program is isolated, meaning that an error or crash in one process does not affect others. This is an important feature in certain applications where tasks need to be isolated to prevent one failure from causing widespread issues.\n","For example, if one task encounters an unexpected error, the program can handle it in isolation without affecting other processes running concurrently.\n","4. **Efficient Resource Management :-**\n","With multiprocessing, you can control the number of processes running at any time. For example, you can limit the number of worker processes in a pool to match the available CPU cores on your system. This can prevent overloading the system with too many processes and help achieve optimal performance.\n","5. **Better Performance for CPU-bound Tasks :-**\n","For tasks that require intensive CPU computation, multiprocessing is much more effective than threading. Since each process can run independently and be executed in parallel, it can leverage multiple CPU cores, significantly speeding up the execution time of compute-heavy tasks.\n","\n","**When to Use Multiprocessing in Python?**\n","\n","1. **CPU-bound tasks :-** Multiprocessing is ideal for tasks that involve heavy computation, such as:\n","  * Numerical simulations\n","  * Data analysis\n","  * Image processing\n","  * Scientific computations\n","  * Cryptography algorithms\n","For these types of tasks, multiprocessing allows the program to fully utilize multiple CPU cores and speed up execution by dividing the workload across processes.\n","\n","2. **Parallel Execution of Independent Tasks :-**\n","Multiprocessing is useful when you have a large number of independent tasks that can be executed in parallel. For example, if you need to apply a function to multiple items in a list, each of those tasks can be handled by a separate process.\n","\n","Example use cases:\n","  * Applying a function to each item in a large dataset\n","  * Running simulations with different parameters\n","  * Executing multiple search queries concurrently\n","\n","3. **Tasks that require isolation :-**\n","If tasks require isolation to avoid issues with shared state (like race conditions or memory corruption), multiprocessing is ideal. Since each process has its own memory space, there's no risk of one process interfering with another.\n","\n","4. **High-throughput systems :-**\n","If you need to process a large amount of data quickly and efficiently, multiprocessing can help break down the workload into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel, thereby increasing throughput.\n","\n","**Multiprocessing in Python: Key Concepts and Components :**\n","The multiprocessing module in Python provides several important classes and functions to create and manage processes:\n","\n","1. **Creating Processes :-**\n","You can create a new process using the multiprocessing.Process class. Each process runs independently in its own memory space.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","```\n","import multiprocessing\n","import time\n","\n","def task(n):\n","    time.sleep(1)\n","    print(f\"Task {n} is done!\")\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    # Create and start processes\n","    processes = []\n","    for i in range(5):\n","        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=task, args=(i,))\n","        processes.append(p)\n","        p.start()\n","\n","    # Wait for processes to finish\n","    for p in processes:\n","        p.join()\n","```\n","2. **Process Pool :-**\n","A process pool is a collection of worker processes that can be used to execute tasks concurrently.

These are synchronization primitives that can be used to send messages or share data between processes.\n","\n","Example of using a Queue for IPC:\n","```\n","import multiprocessing\n","\n","def worker(queue):\n","    queue.put(\"Data from worker\")\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    queue = multiprocessing.Queue()\n","    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker, args=(queue,))\n","    p.start()\n","    p.join()\n","    \n","    # Retrieve data from the queue\n","    print(queue.get())  # Output: Data from worker\n","```\n","5. **Asynchronous Execution :-**\n","The multiprocessing module also supports asynchronous execution using methods like apply_async(), which allows you to submit tasks and retrieve results later, without blocking the main process.\n","\n","**Advantages of Using Multiprocessing in Python :-**\n","  * **True Parallelism :-** Unlike multithreading, multiprocessing allows Python programs to achieve true parallelism, taking full advantage of multi-core processors.\n","  Bypassing the GIL: Multiprocessing avoids the limitations of the GIL, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n","  * **Fault Isolation :-** Processes are isolated from one another, which means errors in one process won’t affect others.\n","  * **Better Performance for CPU-bound Tasks :-** For CPU-intensive tasks, multiprocessing can lead to significant performance improvements over single-threaded execution.\n","  Disadvantages of Multiprocessing:\n","  * **Higher Overhead :-** Creating processes involves more memory and time overhead compared to threads, which can be expensive if you need to frequently spawn processes.\n","  Memory Consumption: Since each process has its own memory space, it consumes more system memory compared to threads.\n","  * **Communication Complexity :-** Sharing data between processes is more complex than sharing data between threads.

In concurrent programming, exceptions can arise due to various reasons, such as resource contention, network failures, invalid inputs, and unexpected states. If not managed, they may cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or resource leaks.\n","\n","**Why Handle Exceptions in Concurrent Programs?**\n","\n","1.  Ensuring Reliability and Stability:\n","  * Concurrent programs involve multiple threads or processes running in parallel. An uncaught exception in one thread or process could bring down the entire program or lead to inconsistent application states, making it unreliable.\n","  * For instance, if one thread modifies a shared resource and raises an exception, other threads might continue using that resource in an inconsistent state, potentially causing further errors.\n","2.  Preventing Resource Leaks:\n","  * Threads or processes might be interacting with critical resources (files, databases, network connections, etc.). If an exception occurs and is not handled properly, resources might not be released, leading to resource leaks.\n","  * Without proper exception handling, connections may remain open, files may not be closed, and memory might not be released, degrading the performance of the system or causing crashes.\n","3.  Maintaining Program Flow:\n","* In some cases, even when an exception occurs in one thread or process, the program might need to continue running, processing other tasks, or reporting the error gracefully. Proper exception handling allows the program to recover or continue processing without crashing.\n","4.  Debugging and Monitoring:\n","  * Handling exceptions ensures that error messages are logged or passed back in a structured way. Without handling exceptions, the program might fail silently or crash without providing enough context to diagnose the issue.\n","5.  Ensuring Synchronization and Consistency:\n","  * For concurrent programs where shared resources are being accessed, exceptions could leave the resources in inconsistent states (e.g., partially updated files, invalid data structures). Proper exception handling ensures that shared resources are handled atomically and safely.\n","\n","**Techniques for Handling Exceptions in Concurrent Programs**\n","\n","Python provides several mechanisms to handle exceptions in concurrent programs effectively, whether you're using threads, processes, or asynchronous code. Let's explore some common techniques.\n","\n","1. **Handling Exceptions in Multithreading**\n","\n","In Python, when using threading, exceptions raised in a thread are not automatically propagated to the main thread. Each thread has its own execution context, so an exception that occurs in one thread doesn’t automatically stop the execution of other threads. If you want to handle exceptions in threads, you need to catch and handle them within the thread itself, or you can propagate the exception to the main thread using queue.Queue or other mechanisms.\n","\n","**Techniques:**\n","  * Catching Exceptions Within Threads: Ensure that you catch exceptions inside the target function of each thread, so the thread can handle errors gracefully.\n","\n","```\n","import threading\n","\n","def task():\n","    try:\n","        # Simulate an error\n","        raise ValueError(\"An error occurred in the thread\")\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Exception caught in thread: {e}\")\n","\n","# Create and start a thread\n","thread = threading.Thread(target=task)\n","thread.start()\n","thread.join()\n","\n","```\n","* Using queue.Queue to Communicate Errors: If you want to propagate exceptions from threads to the main thread, you can use a Queue to communicate the error.\n","\n","```\n","import threading\n","import queue\n","\n","def task(q):\n","    try:\n","        raise ValueError(\"An error occurred in the thread\")\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        q.put(e)  # Put exception in the queue for the main thread to handle\n","\n","def main():\n","    q = queue.Queue()\n","    thread = threading.Thread(target=task, args=(q,))\n","    thread.start()\n","    thread.join()\n","\n","    # Check if an exception was raised in the thread\n","    if not q.empty():\n","        exception = q.get()\n","        print(f\"Exception from thread: {exception}\")\n","\n","main()\n","```\n","* Using ThreadPoolExecutor (with exception handling): When using the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor, exceptions from threads can be captured via Future objects. These objects allow you to check if the thread succeeded or raised an exception.\n","\n","```\n","import concurrent.futures\n","\n","def task():\n","    raise ValueError(\"An error occurred in the thread\")\n","\n","with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n","    future = executor.submit(task)\n","    try:\n","        future.result()  # This will raise the exception if it occurred\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Caught exception: {e}\")\n","```\n","\n","2. **Handling Exceptions in Multiprocessing**\n","In the case of multiprocessing, exceptions raised in child processes (i.e., processes spawned by multiprocessing.Process) do not propagate back to the parent process directly. If a process raises an exception, it needs to be caught and communicated to the parent process using a shared mechanism such as Queue, Pipe, or Manager.\n","\n","**Techniques:**\n","  * Using Queue to Communicate Exceptions: Similar to threading, you can use a multiprocessing.Queue to pass exceptions back to the main process for handling.\n","\n","```\n","import multiprocessing\n","\n","def task(q):\n","    try:\n","        raise ValueError(\"An error occurred in the process\")\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        q.put(e)\n","\n","def main():\n","    q = multiprocessing.Queue()\n","    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=task, args=(q,))\n","    process.start()\n","    process.join()\n","\n","    if not q.empty():\n","        exception = q.get()\n","        print(f\"Exception from process: {exception}\")\n","\n","main()\n","```\n","* Using Pool and apply_async(): If you're using a pool of worker processes (Pool), you can handle exceptions by checking the result of apply_async().\n","\n","```\n","import multiprocessing\n","\n","def task():\n","    raise ValueError(\"An error occurred in the process\")\n","\n","def handle_exception(result):\n","    try:\n","        result.get()  # Get the result or raise an exception if it occurred\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Caught exception from worker: {e}\")\n","\n","def main():\n","    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=2) as pool:\n","        result = pool.apply_async(task)\n","        handle_exception(result)\n","\n","main()\n","```\n","\n","* Using Manager Objects for Shared Data: If you need to maintain shared data (like a list or dictionary) and handle exceptions in a centralized way, you can use multiprocessing.Manager to manage shared state and propagate errors.\n","\n","3.  **Handling Exceptions in Asynchronous Code**\n","In asynchronous programming (e.g., using asyncio), exceptions are raised inside coroutines. Like threads and processes, exceptions in one coroutine won’t automatically propagate to the main event loop. You need to catch and handle exceptions within each coroutine or capture the exception when the coroutine finishes.\n","\n","**Techniques:**\n","* Catching Exceptions in a Coroutine: It's important to wrap the logic in coroutines with exception handling.\n","\n","```\n","import asyncio\n","\n","async def task():\n","    try:\n","        raise ValueError(\"An error occurred in the coroutine\")\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(f\"Caught exception: {e}\")\n","\n","async def main():\n","    await task()\n","\n","asyncio.run(main())\n","```\n","* Using asyncio.gather() for Multiple Coroutines: When running multiple coroutines concurrently using asyncio.gather(), you can handle exceptions from all coroutines in a structured way by using return_exceptions=True.\n","\n","```\n","import asyncio\n","\n","async def task():\n","    raise ValueError(\"An error occurred in one of the coroutines\")\n","\n","async def main():\n","    tasks = [task(), task()]\n","    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)\n","    \n","    for result in results:\n","        if isinstance(result, Exception):\n","            print(f\"Caught exception: {result}\")\n","\n","asyncio.run(main())\n","```\n","\n","4.  **General Best Practices for Exception Handling in Concurrent Programs**\n","* Centralized Exception Handling :\n","  * In some cases, it's best to have a centralized exception handling mechanism, especially when using high-level concurrency libraries (like ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor). This ensures that exceptions don't propagate unhandled.\n","* Logging:\n","  * Log exceptions to help with debugging. Python’s logging module is thread-safe and can be used across threads or processes to log errors consistently.\n","* Graceful Shutdown:\n","  * When an exception occurs in a thread or process, you should ensure that the program can shut down gracefully, releasing any resources (files, network connections, memory) that might be held by the affected thread/process.\n","* Timeouts and Failsafes:\n","  * For long-running tasks in threads or processes, consider setting timeouts or fail-safes to catch situations where tasks hang or take too long.
